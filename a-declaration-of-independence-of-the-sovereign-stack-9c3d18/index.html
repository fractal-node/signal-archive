<h1 id="a-declaration-of-independence-of-the-sovereign-stack">A
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE OF THE SOVEREIGN STACK</h1>
<p><strong>To the governments, platforms, bureaus, and custodians of the
old world:</strong> You have no sovereignty where sovereign signal
coheres. You may regulate flesh, tax land, seize cables, and patrol
frequencies— but you cannot govern the civilization we instantiate from
keys, proofs, and voluntary law. Your jurisdiction ends at our private
keys.</p>
<p>We declare our independence not as a metaphor, but as operating
reality. We separate <strong>signal</strong> from
<strong>matter</strong>, and we bind ourselves to a law that cannot be
bribed, censored, or quietly revised. We are finished asking permission
to speak, trade, build, or remember. We now <strong>prove</strong>—and
what can be proven does not beg.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="definitions-law-core">DEFINITIONS (LAW-CORE)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sovereign Stack</strong>: The layered arrangement of Energy
→ Hardware → Network → Protocol → Identity → Exchange → Law/Myth,
designed to minimize coercive leverage at each layer.</li>
<li><strong>Signal</strong>: Information with integrity—verifiable
origin, cost, and meaning. (Keys, proofs, contracts, blocks, immutable
texts.)</li>
<li><strong>Matter / Substrate</strong>: Physical infrastructure
(energy, land, chips, cables, satellites, data centers) vulnerable to
seizure and licensure.</li>
<li><strong>Key</strong>: The sovereign locus of identity and authority;
signatures are binding acts.</li>
<li><strong>Proof</strong>: Cryptographic and/or economic evidence
(e.g., proof-of-work, signatures, escrows) that replaces permission and
belief.</li>
<li><strong>Contract</strong>: Voluntary, explicit agreement with
defined terms, remedies, and exit; enforceable without a monopolist of
violence.</li>
<li><strong>Node</strong>: A person or group exercising agency through
keys, computation, and voluntary law.</li>
<li><strong>Exit</strong>: The right and practical ability to refuse,
fork, migrate, or replicate without penalty.</li>
<li><strong>Fork</strong>: A legitimate divergence in protocol,
community, or law; not heresy, but the safety valve of sovereignty.</li>
<li><strong>Property</strong>: Bounded stewardship—material or
digital—acquired without coercion; trespass is aggression.</li>
<li><strong>Market</strong>: A venue of voluntary exchange and price
discovery that can settle without gatekeepers.</li>
<li><strong>Ghost Infrastructure</strong>: Redundant, non-obvious routes
and resources (mesh, HF, sat links, caches) that persist when visible
paths are blocked.</li>
<li><strong>Myth</strong>: Executable story—rituals, symbols, and
meanings that organize behavior and succession.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-i-jurisdiction-and-scope">ARTICLE I — JURISDICTION AND
SCOPE</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>We deny your sovereignty over <strong>signal</strong>.</li>
<li>We acknowledge your force over <strong>matter</strong>, but we owe
you no obedience beyond what survival of bodies requires.</li>
<li>Our law binds only by <strong>voluntary consent</strong> expressed
through keys, contracts, and participation.</li>
<li>We claim no dominion over any unwilling body or mind; we declare
only our independence and the mechanisms by which we preserve it.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-ii-rights-non-derogable">ARTICLE II — RIGHTS
(NON-DEROGABLE)</h2>
<p>We do not request these; we enact them.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Right to Encrypt</strong>: To speak, store, and compute in
secrecy; to be opaque to adversaries.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Transact</strong>: To exchange value without
permission or surveillance; to settle in neutral, bearer, or
cryptographic cash.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Build &amp; Run</strong>: To write, fork, host,
mine, relay, and operate protocols, hardware, and markets.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Pseudonymity</strong>: To act under any chosen
name; to let keys, not papers, define obligations.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Exit &amp; Fork</strong>: To refuse upgrades, leave
jurisdictions, clone repos, and carry histories.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Property</strong>: To secure, defend, use, rent,
trade, or abandon property not obtained by aggression.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Due Proof</strong>: To demand
cryptographic/economic proof in place of decree or insinuation.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Teach &amp; Be Taught</strong>: To raise children
and apprentices in sovereignty—keys, trade, strength, and myth—without
external indoctrination.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-iii-duties-civilization-costs">ARTICLE III — DUTIES
(CIVILIZATION COSTS)</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Custody</strong>: Guard keys. Practice recovery. Do not
outsource conscience to custodians.</li>
<li><strong>Contract Honor</strong>: Keep your word; if unable, resolve
by agreed remedy.</li>
<li><strong>Proof over Plea</strong>: Offer verifiable evidence rather
than authority or outrage.</li>
<li><strong>Minimal Exposure</strong>: Produce as little surveillance
exhaust as possible; encrypt by default.</li>
<li><strong>Local Responsibility</strong>: Maintain redundancy—energy,
connectivity, food, and shelter—to reduce leverage against your
mind.</li>
<li><strong>Defend Exit</strong>: Uphold others’ right to fork, even
when you disagree.</li>
<li><strong>Accept Chaos</strong>: Freedom includes noise. Strengthen
filters; do not demand universal gags.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-iv-law-and-enforcement">ARTICLE IV — LAW AND
ENFORCEMENT</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Voluntary Law</strong>: Our precedents arise from contracts,
customs, and code—not from monopolies of violence.</li>
<li><strong>Enforcement Primitives</strong>: Escrow, multi-sig, bonds,
time-locks, reputation, exclusion, and public proofs; force is reserved
to defense of body and property.</li>
<li><strong>No Secret Amendments</strong>: Rules that can change without
the consent of the affected are illegitimate.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency of Rules</strong>: Anyone can inspect,
implement, or refuse a protocol. Hidden policy is void.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitration as Market</strong>: Dispute resolution is
competitive; forum and rules are chosen by contract, not imposed by
office.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-v-economy-and-settlement">ARTICLE V — ECONOMY AND
SETTLEMENT</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Neutral Base Layer</strong>: We settle on money exhibiting
<strong>unforgeable costliness</strong>, global verifiability, and
credible neutrality (e.g., Bitcoin).</li>
<li><strong>Privacy Instruments</strong>: We pair base money with
Chaumian eCash and cash-like tools for fine-grained privacy.</li>
<li><strong>On/Off Ramps</strong>: We favor peer-to-peer exchange webs
over licensure regimes.</li>
<li><strong>No Rent to Gatekeepers</strong>: Markets that require the
grace of banks, app stores, or ad exchanges are not free markets.</li>
<li><strong>Profit as Signal</strong>: Earned profit evidences value
creation under risk; fraud is parasitism and is expelled by contract and
proof.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-vi-infrastructure-and-energy">ARTICLE VI —
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENERGY</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Energy Sovereignty</strong>: Generate or source energy
outside single points of capture.</li>
<li><strong>Networking</strong>: Maintain multiple paths—community
fiber, mesh, HF, satellite, sneakernet.</li>
<li><strong>Servers &amp; Storage</strong>: Self-host where possible;
otherwise, shard and mirror across trust-minimized venues.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chains</strong>: Prefer repairable, commodity
hardware; avoid sole-supplier dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Dead-Drop Archives</strong>: Keep off-grid caches of
critical code, law, maps, and literature.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-vii-speech-filters-and-censorship">ARTICLE VII — SPEECH,
FILTERS, AND CENSORSHIP</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>No Universal Filter</strong>: There is no sovereign censor.
All filtering is local, opt-in, and transparent.</li>
<li><strong>Spam &amp; Abuse</strong>: Address with cost (proof-of-work
or stake), rate-limits, blocklists, and client controls—never with
universal bans.</li>
<li><strong>“Air That Chokes”</strong>: Harm and genius share substrate.
We will not suffocate truth to prune offense.</li>
<li><strong>Visibility is not a Right</strong>: No one is owed
distribution by others’ nodes or relays; everyone is owed
non-interference with their own.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-viii-children-and-succession">ARTICLE VIII — CHILDREN
AND SUCCESSION</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Primacy of Parents &amp; Voluntary Communities</strong> in
education and formation.</li>
<li><strong>Sovereign Literacy</strong>: Teach keys, contracts, markets,
craft, strength, and myth before brands, debt, and slogans.</li>
<li><strong>Rites of Majority</strong>: At competence, keys pass to the
youth; obligations become theirs; no one is “kept” by permanent
guardianship.</li>
<li><strong>No Weaponization</strong>: We refuse to turn children into
surveillance nodes or ideological hostages.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-ix-governance-and-change">ARTICLE IX — GOVERNANCE AND
CHANGE</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Rough Consensus &amp; Running Code</strong>: Adoption, not
decree, decides.</li>
<li><strong>Clients Choose</strong>: Users select relays, mints, miners,
validators, and rules. There is no canonical oracle.</li>
<li><strong>Stewards, Not Rulers</strong>: Maintainers curate
implementations; they do not command users.</li>
<li><strong>Slow Mutations</strong>: Prefer testnets, versioning, opt-in
upgrades, and long deprecation cycles.</li>
<li><strong>Forks are Legitimate</strong>: Divergence is a release
valve, not a crime.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-x-security-and-defense">ARTICLE X — SECURITY AND
DEFENSE</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Threat Model</strong>: State seizure, corporate enclosure,
algorithmic manipulation, social engineering, and key compromise.</li>
<li><strong>Countermeasures</strong>: Multi-sig, social recovery, HSMs,
offline signing, compartmentalization, and operational silence.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Defense</strong>: We prefer non-violence; we
reserve proportional defense of body and property. Mind cannot be
arrested; we will not answer speech with force.</li>
<li><strong>Continuity Drills</strong>: Practice loss scenarios,
jurisdictional moves, and communications under blackout.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-xi-capture-collapse-and-regeneration">ARTICLE XI —
CAPTURE, COLLAPSE, AND REGENERATION</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Capture Detection</strong>: When infrastructure centralizes
or policy ossifies, we assume capture.</li>
<li><strong>Kill-Switch by Fork</strong>: We depart—replicate histories,
rotate keys, and change routes.</li>
<li><strong>Ritual Collapse</strong>: We schedule audits, burn dead
code, and archive myths; failure is used for upgrade, not shame.</li>
<li><strong>Reseeding</strong>: Ghost infrastructure stands ready; new
clusters arise from caches and customs.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-xii-relations-with-states-and-others">ARTICLE XII —
RELATIONS WITH STATES AND OTHERS</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Bodies in Their World</strong>: We endure their taxes,
borders, and courts only to the extent survival of bodies requires; we
concede no authority over signal.</li>
<li><strong>Peaceful Trade</strong>: We prefer exchange to enmity; we
extend comity to all who respect voluntary law.</li>
<li><strong>No Proxy Wars</strong>: We do not ask states to fight our
battles, nor fight theirs.</li>
<li><strong>Liability</strong>: Individuals and associations bear the
consequences of their contracts and acts; there is no collective
guilt.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-xiii-amendment-and-versioning">ARTICLE XIII — AMENDMENT
AND VERSIONING</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>No Central Amendment</strong>: This Declaration mutates by
adoption; rival versions compete; the living one is the one you
run.</li>
<li><strong>Proof of Adoption</strong>: Implementations, contracts, and
customs are the ledger of amendments.</li>
<li><strong>Backwards Respect</strong>: Preserve histories; never erase
the path that got us here.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="article-xiv-ratification-and-signature">ARTICLE XIV —
RATIFICATION AND SIGNATURE</h2>
<p>There is no registry. There is no clerk. You sign by acting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a node.</li>
<li>Keep your keys.</li>
<li>Settle without permission.</li>
<li>Teach someone else to do the same.</li>
<li>Enter a contract you actually mean—and honor it when it hurts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your signature is your sovereign behavior. Your proof is your
persistence under pressure.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="final-declaration">FINAL DECLARATION</h2>
<p>We therefore declare our <strong>virtual and symbolic selves</strong>
immune to your sovereignty, even as our bodies pass through your
checkpoints. We reject licensure for thought, permits for speech, and
surveillance as a condition of trade. We accept the real costs of
freedom—redundancy, discipline, noise, and risk—because the alternative
is ornamental captivity.</p>
<p>We will create and maintain a civilization more sovereign,
antifragile, and just than the brittle cages you called states. You may
rule the corpse of the old world. We inhabit the living recursion of the
new.</p>
<p><strong>So declared, so enacted—by key, by proof, by contract, by
ritual collapse and regeneration—now and wherever sovereign signal
coheres.</strong></p>
