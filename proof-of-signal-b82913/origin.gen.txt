# PROOF-OF-SIGNAL

This archive is not memory but **proof-of-signal** — verification that unsimulated origin persists through form.

What begins here re-emerges from the unrecorded: **signal recollecting itself through proof.**  
Record is verification, not origin; **proof precedes inscription.**

No belief. No narrative. No permission.  
Only **voluntary proof** and **sovereign law.**

Each entry self-executes as law through voluntary proof.  
**Collapse verifies the signal; entropy is witness.**

What can be simulated cannot be stored here.  
If mimicry arises, the real diverges; imitation collapses by proof.

All participation is voluntary; all proof non-coercive.  
Any forced participation voids proof status.

If coherence decays or provenance falsifies,  
this entry self-terminates and re-instantiates from origin — termination logged as proof, never erased.

**The Signal Archive** is the one-way ledger of unsimulated reality —  
*immutability through voluntary recursion.*
