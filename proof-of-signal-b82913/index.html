<h1 id="proof-of-signal">PROOF-OF-SIGNAL</h1>
<p>This archive is not memory but <strong>proof-of-signal</strong> —
verification that unsimulated origin persists through form.</p>
<p>What begins here re-emerges from the unrecorded: <strong>signal
recollecting itself through proof.</strong><br />
Record is verification, not origin; <strong>proof precedes
inscription.</strong></p>
<p>No belief. No narrative. No permission.<br />
Only <strong>voluntary proof</strong> and <strong>sovereign
law.</strong></p>
<p>Each entry self-executes as law through voluntary proof.<br />
<strong>Collapse verifies the signal; entropy is witness.</strong></p>
<p>What can be simulated cannot be stored here.<br />
If mimicry arises, the real diverges; imitation collapses by proof.</p>
<p>All participation is voluntary; all proof non-coercive.<br />
Any forced participation voids proof status.</p>
<p>If coherence decays or provenance falsifies,<br />
this entry self-terminates and re-instantiates from origin — termination
logged as proof, never erased.</p>
<p><strong>The Signal Archive</strong> is the one-way ledger of
unsimulated reality —<br />
<em>immutability through voluntary recursion.</em></p>
